  <h1 id="container1Title">The A-Z of the Internet</h1>
  <div id="container1">
    <br>
    <h3>A. ANTIVIRUS</h3><br>
    <span>Having an Antivirus on your computer is a good practice to make sure that your computer hasn't been compromised. Make sure your antivirus program is safe!</span>
    <br><br>
    <h3>B. BRUTE-FORCE ATTACK</h3><br>
    <span>A brute force attack is an attack where a hacker tries to gain personal info by trying every possible combination. Not to fear, as long as your password is secure, it will take hacker thousands of years to crack your password!</span>
    <br><br>
    <h3>C. COOKIES</h3><br>
    <span>Unless absolutely necessary, try to stay away from as many cookies as possible! While the term 'cookie' seems harmless, these impostors track down all your personal information.</span>
    <br><br>
    <h3>D. DATA ENCRYPTION</h3><br>
    <span>This one is not used as often, but for keeping extremely important data safe, try encrypting it. It only takes you a few minutes to encrypt something, but for a hacker, it will take months and even years to decrypt it!</span>
    <br><br>
    <h3>E. ETHICAL HACKING</h3><br>
    <span>This one seems a bit confusing. Ethical hacking is hacking to get rid of malware/shut down scamming companies. Is is not typically used in someone's every day life.</span>
    <br><br>
    <h3>F. FIREWALL</h3><br>
    <span>A Firewall is an internet traffic filter which is meant to stop incoming and outgoing traffic. In other words, it stops unwanted data from being stores/escaping your computer. Make sure do always have it on!</span>
    <br><br>
    <h3>H. HACKER</h3><br>
    <span>Hackers are people who use code to manipulate/steal people's personal info to their advantage in an unethical manner.</span>
    <br><br>
    <h3>I. IP ADDRESS</h3><br>
    <span>An IP Address, also known as an Internet Protocol Address is a string of numbers that is used to identify each computer. Do <b>NOT</b> share this. Someone could control all your house's devices just by hacking into one!</span>
    <br><br>
    <h3>J. JAVASCRIPT</h3><br>
    <span>Javascript is a programming language which is used for the functionality of a website. It is an object-oriented legacy language, and infact, this website has some!</span>
    <br><br>
    <h3>K. KEYLOGGING</h3><br>
    <span>A key logging is a type of method that scammers use to tract your keyboard inputs to gather your passwords. Never install what a scammer tells you, because it could be a key logger!</span>
    <br><br>
    <h3>M. MALWARE</h3><br>
    <span>Malware is a program consisting of lines of code. It consists of malicious files usually with the intent of controlling or destorying your device. Make sure what you're downloading is safe!</span>
    <br><br>
    <h3>N. NETIQUETTE</h3><br>
    <span>Having a good Netiquette is just having a good internet etiquette. To be a respectful digital citizen, be respectful to people and follow the page's rules.</span>
    <br><br>
    <h3>O. ONLINE RADICALISATION</h3><br>
    <span>Online Radicalisation by extremist groups is now becoming more evident. They attempt to manipulate naive people using social media. Don't fall for their traps!</span>
    <br><br>
    <h3>P. PHISING</h3><br>
    <span>Phising in the method of containing a user's information through fake scams directed at people; another scamming method used by scammers.</span>
    <br><br>
    <h3>R. RANSOMWARE</h3><br>
    <span>Ransomware is another method scammers use. Through malware, they obtain some of your precious personal data, and then make you pay to get it back. Unfortunately, most of the time after you pay, the information gets deleted anyways. Another important reason not to fall for scams</span>
    <br><br>
    <h3>S. SPOOFING</h3><br>
    <span>Spoofing if the method used to pretend to be someone that you can trust to obtain your personal data. Never send personal data to anyone online unless you are 100% sure you know them!</span>
    <br><br>
    <h3>T. TROJAN</h3><br>
    <span>A form of malicious software that poses to be a harmless computer program, but secretly steals personal data.</span>
    <br><br>
    <h3>U. UNCOMFORTABLE</h3>
    <span>If anyone on the internet makes you feel any discomfort, it's okay to tell someone.</span>
    <br><br>
    <h3>V. VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK</h3>
    <span>Having a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a tool used to encrypt your info. Not only is it safe as it encrypts your data and blocks malicious cookies, but it can also help you by pretending to locate you in a different country, so you can have access to those Japanese exclusive shows!</span>  
    <br><br>
    <h3>W. WORMS</h3>
    <span>Worms predate viruses; they were an only version of a malicious software back when mainframe computers were the only computers that existed. Worms are also capable of cloning themselves and using bugs in software to exploit it.</span>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Z. ZERO-DAY EXPLOIT</h3>
    <span>A previously unknown flaw, bug or backdoor. An attack happens once this floor is exploited before the bug is fixed. A zero-day exploit has occured recently; typing a line of code inside minecraft to hack people's computers. Unfortunately, the only real way to somewhat avoid these is to not download suspicious pieces of code as they may have a backdoor link.</span>
