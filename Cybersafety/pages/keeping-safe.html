  <h1 id="container1Title">How to Keep Safe on the Internet</h1>
  <br>
  <div id="container1">
    <br>
    <p>Keeping Safe on the internet is extremely important. If it is not done, it could lead to catastrophic outcomes, ranging from an infected device to even money loss! But no need to worry, here are a few simple tips and tricks to make sure that you are safe on the internet!</p>
    <br>
    <h3>1. VIRUSTOTAL</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="cardContent" id="element">
        <h2 class="cardTitle">VirusTotal</h2>
        <p class="cardBody">A great website for checking files for viruses, even before you download it!</p>
        <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url" target="_blank"class="button">Go to VirusTotal</a>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>One of the key features of the internet is being able to upload and download files. A lot if not all of your apps are from the internet. However, you still need to be careful. Some useful looking apps may have virues hidden inside them, and downloading it could ruin your device. There aren't very many ways to test files for viruses before downloading it. However, that has changed with just  one website.</p>
    <p>VirusTotal is an excellent website to check if files are safe. After inserting the link address to the suspicious file, it will use more than 83 anti-virus engines to scan the files for any malicious activity. It even supplies comments made by the community and the overall rating by the community. It is one of the perfect tools to see if files are safe before downloading it. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>2.  BE CAREFUL WHO YOU TRUST</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I'm sure many of you here have met someone who have seemed trustworthy on the internet. Unless you are <b>100%</b> sure that they are who they say they are, never <u>EVER</u> share your personal information. There have been hundreds and thousands of cases where someone gives personal info to a "trusted" person on the internet, only for them to get stolen from/held ransom. The only way to tell if they are who they say they are is to have a call where you can see their face. Even then, make sure that your personal data is kept a secret unless you absolutely need to share it.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>3.  USE SECURE PASSWORDS</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I cannot stress this one enough. Use secure passwords! Don't use passwords that have your name, or don't use passwords that have your username. DON'T just make your password a bunch of words. A good password level will include: a capital Letter, at least 1 number and some form of punctuation (for example: Lorem.Ipsum1). Also make sure that you're passwords don't repeat for different sites. It will be  acceptable even if you just add a word! If one sketchy website has a data leak, your accounts and your email could be compromised! An even better alternative is to use super safe passwords that are usually recommended. These are almost impossible to crack and will take a hacker using brute-force years to crack! (for example: Jhf67Sh89S! .)</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>4.  WATCH OUT FOR SKETCHY LINKS</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Watch out for sketchy website links! While websites can seem harmless, as soon as you click on the website's link, it could easily give your PC a virus and you wouldn't even know! This is why it is very important to not click on sketchy links.
      We've all seen those bots in Youtube comments spamming links to their videos. Do <u>NOT</u> click on these links. While most of these links are harmless self-advertising, some of them can be harmful links poising to be a safe/trusted link.

    <br>
    <h3>5.  UPDATE YOUR BROWSER</h3>
    <br>
    <p>While using an older version of a browser doesn't seem to be too big of a problem, make sure to keep your browser updated. Newer versions of browser have more anti-virus features, making it safer. Same thing for your operating system. For example, most Windows updates add more security measures to your machines database.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you follow all these tips, there's no doubt that you will be safe on the Internet! I hope this guide helped you :)</p>
